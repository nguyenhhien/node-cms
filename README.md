# NodeCMS
 A hobby project was self-written quite sometimes ago. Code base is quite large though. (just change this from private -> public repo)
 
 It shows:
 
   -How to integrate and structure ExpressJS, SocketIO with Sequelize, Mongoose and other component.
   
   -How to structure the AngularJS as frontend.
   
 It can be use as starting point to build your own NodeJS server.  


## Tech stack:
### Server side:
```
* NodeJs > 0.11 (for harmony feature)
* Express.Js
* Sequelize for ORM.
* Moongoose for Mongo.
* Socket.Io for websocket
* MySQL + Mongo + Redis (as main data store)
* Nginx as reverse proxy
* Jasmine as testing framework
```

### Client Side:
```
* AngularJs
* Bootstrap
* Less(for css)
* Grunt (as asset compiler)
```
